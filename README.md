# tracks

Tracks is a tool to rename audio files generated by [Waves Tracks Live][tracks_live] based on channel or output names from an [Avid VENUE™][avid_venue] (version 4.5.x or earlier) patch file.

## Overview

Waves Tracks is an invaluable tool for doing a multi-track recording during a live event. Once the event is over, getting those files into Pro Tools or can be a pain for several reasons.

- The file names are all "Track XX-Y.wav", giving no indication of the original channel name.
- Tracks are sorted alphabetically by track number then session number, making it difficult to pull out all tracks relating to a single session.
- The alphabetic sorting of 32 tracks looks like: 1 10 11 12 … 2 20 21 22 … 3 31 32 4 5. Dragging all the tracks sorted this way into Pro Tools requires manually resorting the tracks by hand.

This software is designed to solve the above problems.

- Files are renamed according to their original channel names, or the Pro Tools output patch names.
- Session numbers are placed before track numbers, which groups the sessions together.

## Project detail

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/kward/tracks?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/kward/tracks)
[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/kward/tracks.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kward/tracks)

The software is distributed as source code. To compile the code, the [Go programming language](https://golang.org/) must be installed, and the source code and relative libraries installed. See the [Installation](#installation) section below for the necessary steps.

:bulb: Waves Tracks Live is a heavily striped down version of the open source DAW software [Ardour](https://ardour.org/). If you are are on a budget, and need something that will do more than recording and playback, give Ardour a try.

## Usage
The example below will make a new copy of all files in a new location. You will need enough space in your destination location to hold these files.

:bulb: In the examples below, you will frequently see the character `~` used in paths. This character is a Unix shell alias for your home directory. On macOS (or Mac OS X), this is equivalent to your :house: folder, e.g. `/Users/kward`. On Windows 10 or Windows 7, it is very similar, e.g. `\Users\kward`.

### Saving sessions with Waves Tracks Live

Save your Tracks Live sessions as you normally would. The following screenshot shows that I have saved my session as `~/Music/Tracks Live/20170916 ICF Ladies Night`.

### Exporting a patch list from VENUE

Use the VENUE Patchlist export function, or the Info export function, to write your channel information to a USB stick.

**Export patch list**

**Export info**

![Avid VENUE - Options - System - Info](resources/Avid VENUE - Options - System - Info.png)

VENUE normally writes the patch file to the root of the USB stick with a filename like `Avid VENUE Patch List Sep 10 2017, 4-51 PM.html`. Feel free to copy, move, or rename that file to a location useful to you.

:bulb: Consider moving the file off the USB drive to the same folder as the final location of the renamed files, and give it the name of the session. E.g. `~/Music/Sessions/20170916 ICF Ladies Night.html`

Perform a test run of renaming all tracks. These steps must be done from the Terminal.

:bulb: If you aren't at your console, you can use the standalone VENUE software (Windows only) to export the channel information as well.

### Copy the session files

In this example, we will make a copy of all the files into a newly created `~/Music/Sessions/20170916 ICF Ladies Night Stems` folder. Once we are sure the files are copied as we like, the original `~/Music/Tracks Live/20170916 ICF Ladies Night` folder will be removed.

:warning: The examples below assume that the `tracks` binary was compiled according to the [Installation](#installation)

:bulb: Why add the term `Stems` to the end of the new folder? This isn't required, but when a Pro Tools session is created later, the best name for it will likely be `20170916 ICF Ladies Night`. If that folder already exists, Pro Tools will complain, and require a different name to be chosen. Adding `Stems` allows a Pro Tools folder to be created with the session name, while keeping the stems separate. It is definitely an option to create the Pro Tools session *before* doing these steps so that the files can be copied directly into the appropriate Pro Tools session folder.

:warning: If you chose to rename the files in place by not providing a `dest_dir` flag, it is **highly recommended** that you make a backup of your files before running the software.

Create the new folder. (This could also be done in Finder or Windows Explorer).

```sh
mkdir "~/Music/Sessions/20170916 ICF Ladies Night Stems"
```

Do a dry run of copying the files. :memo: No files will be changed because the `--dry_run` flag was given.

```sh
tracks \
  --src_dir "~/Music/Tracks Live/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/interchange/20170916 ICF Ladies Night/audiofiles" \
  --dest_dir "~/Music/Sessions/20170906 ICF Ladies Night Stems" \
  --patch_file "~/Music/Sessions/20170906 ICF Ladies Night.html" \
  --dry_run
```

Check the output produced. Below is some sample output (scroll to the right).

```sh
Moving:
  "/Users/kward/Music/Tracks Live/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/interchange/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/audiofiles/Track 01-1.wav" --> "/Users/kward/Music/Sessions/20170906 ICF Ladies Night Stems/01-01 Cajon (direct out).wav"
  "/Users/kward/Music/Tracks Live/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/interchange/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/audiofiles/Track 02-1.wav" --> "/Users/kward/Music/Sessions/20170906 ICF Ladies Night Stems/01-02 Shaker (direct out).wav"
  "/Users/kward/Music/Tracks Live/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/interchange/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/audiofiles/Track 03-1.wav" --> "/Users/kward/Music/Sessions/20170906 ICF Ladies Night Stems/01-03 aRuben (direct out).wav"
  "/Users/kward/Music/Tracks Live/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/interchange/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/audiofiles/Track 04-1.wav" --> "/Users/kward/Music/Sessions/20170906 ICF Ladies Night Stems/01-04 aToby-L (direct out).wav"
...
```

Perform the actual copy by running the command again without the `--dry_run` flag (notice the trailing `\` character on the `--patch_file` line was also removed).

```sh
tracks \
  --src_dir "~/Music/Tracks Live/20170906 ICF Ladies Night/interchange/20170916 ICF Ladies Night/audiofiles" \
  --dest_dir "~/Music/Sessions/20170906 ICF Ladies Night Stems" \
  --patch_file "~/Music/Sessions/20170906 ICF Ladies Night.html"
```

The output should be the same as above, but this time the files were actually copied.

:bulb: The default "copy" behavior can be changed by adding the `--behavior` flag with the appropriate behavior (e.g. `--behavior move`).

To see a full list of available flags, request `--help`.

```text
tracks --help
Usage of tracks:
  -behavior string
        File manipulation behavior, one of [copy cp link ln move mv rename] (default "copy")
  -dest_dir string
        Destination directory. Leave empty to rename in place.
  -dry_run
        Do a dry run.
  -patch_file string
        Venue patch file.
  -src_dir string
        Source directory. (default ".")
exit status 2
```

## Installation
_This section covers the installation of Go, required Go libraries, and the Tracks source code._

Download and install the latest version of Go using instructions from https://golang.org/doc/install. The Tracks tool works on all versions of Go starting at v1.6.

To test setup a Ubuntu 16.04 Linux machine, these commands were used:

```sh
sudo apt-get install golang
mkdir ~/opt/go/{bin,pkg,src}
cat <<EOF >~/.bashrc
# Golang
export GOPATH="${HOME}/opt/go"
export GOBIN="${GOPATH}/bin"
PATH="${PATH}:${GOBIN}"
EOF
```

Log out and back in to test that the new environment variables were configured properly.

Download the Tracks tool source code. This will automatically compile the code, and place a binary in the `$GOBIN` directory.

```sh
go get -v -t github.com/kward/tracks
```

Test the installation.

```sh
tracks --help
Usage of tracks:
  -behavior string
        File manipulation behavior, one of [copy cp link ln move mv rename] (default "copy")
  -dest_dir string
        Destination directory. Leave empty to rename in place.
  -dry_run
        Do a dry run.
  -patch_file string
        Venue patch file.
  -src_dir string
        Source directory. (default ".")

```

## Updating
_This section covers updating an existing installation._

To update the software, run the following command to download the latest source, and compile a new binary.
